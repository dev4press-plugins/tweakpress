# Dev4Press WPMU Plugins Collection

This is a collection of small WordPress `must use` plugins that are simple to configure and install through the WordPress `mu-plugins` system. The list of plugins is expected to grow over time, and more usefult snippets will be included.

If needed, scripts will be updated for newer WordPress version. Right now, they are tested with latest WordPress 5.5.

To learn more about this collection, about WordPress must use plugins and about individual plugins in this collection, check out the GitHub Wiki pages.
